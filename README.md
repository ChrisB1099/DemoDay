 ## How It's Made:
 Tech used: EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB
 
 This track meetup site was built using EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB to create a dynamic and interactive platform for athletes to connect and collaborate on workouts. The frontend uses EJS as a templating engine to render personalized user data, such as profiles, workout preferences, and nearby tracks, while CSS ensures a responsive and visually appealing design. JavaScript powers client-side interactivity, enabling features like form validation and smooth navigation. On the backend, Node.js, along with Express.js, handles routing, user authentication, and location-based track searches. MongoDB serves as the database, storing user profiles with their best times, workout preferences, and location, as well as geographical track data and track-related articles. This tech stack creates a scalable and efficient platform, allowing users to connect based on shared workout goals, explore local tracks, and stay informed through curated articles.
